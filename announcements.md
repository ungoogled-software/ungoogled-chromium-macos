Many people have asked for notarizing (signing) the Ungoogled-Chromium macOS build ([ungoogled-chromium#859](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/issues/859), [#63](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-macos/issues/63), [#179](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-macos/issues/179)).

Now, we've collected enough funds to cover the cost of the Apple Developer Program membership for 2024-2025 membership year, and we will provide notarized builds later this year (around mid-to-end October 2024). We will keep you updated on the progress.

## Sponsorship

Thanks to the generous support from the following sponsors:

- @pascal-giguere (via GitHub Sponsors)
- @kevingriffin (via GitHub Sponsors)
- BabyFn0rd (via By Me a Coffee)
- dasos (via By Me a Coffee)
- @vinnysaj (via GitHub Sponsors)

which made it possible for us to cover the cost of the Apple Developer Program membership and provide notarized builds of Ungoogled-Chromium macOS. These supports are greatly appreciated!

New sponsors are still very welcomed, as I (@Cubik65536, current maintainer of Ungoogled-Chromium macOS) am still relying on community sponsors to help me cover the cost of the Apple Developer Program fee for future membership years. The progress of the funding for current and next Apple Developer membership year can be tracked on [issue #184](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-macos/issues/184).

Your support will also greatly encourage and motivaes me to continue putting more effort into maintaining and improving Ungoogled-Chromium macOS.
